# Twitter Tweet Network Analyzer
This small Python program makes a network graph using Twitter tweets. Uses _tweepy_ library to connect Twitter's API and _dash_ to plot results.

!! A minor bug when clicking a profile that hasn't tweeted about the searched topic, but someone has mentioned the profile. There also aren't error checks yet !!
