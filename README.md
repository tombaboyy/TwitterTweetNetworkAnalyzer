# Twitter Tweet Network Analyzer
This small Python program makes a network graph using Twitter tweets. Uses _tweepy_ library to connect Twitter's API and _dash_ to plot results.

This is just a fast one-person hobby project, so the commenting and naming of variables isn't that well thought. 

!! A minor bug when clicking a profile that hasn't tweeted about the searched topic, but someone has mentioned the profile. There also aren't error checks yet !!

## How To Use
1. The user must specify the keyword in the variable "HAKUSANA" in the file "get\_tweetss.py"
2. The user must specify the keyword in the variable "määrä" in the file _get\_tweetss.py_
3. The user can run the file "network_analysis.py"
